[nickel.rs](https://nickel-org.github.io) is a simple and lightweight foundation for web applications written in Rust. Its API is inspired by the popular express framework for JavaScript.

## Hello world

```rust,no_run
#[macro_use] extern crate nickel;

use nickel::{Nickel, HttpRouter};

fn main() {
    let mut server = Nickel::new();
    server.get("**", middleware!("Hello World"));
    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}
```

### Dependencies

You'll need to create a *Cargo.toml* that looks like this;

```toml
[package]

name = "my-nickel-app"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = ["yourname"]

[dependencies.nickel]
version = "*"
# If you are using the 'nightly' rust channel you can uncomment
# the line below to activate unstable features
# features = ["unstable"]

# Some examples require the `rustc_serialize` crate, which will
# require uncommenting the lines below
# [dependencies]
# rustc-serialize = "*"
```

You can then compile this using *Cargo build* and run it using *Cargo run*. After it's running you should visit http://localhost:6767 to see your hello world!
